# FRC2024_308

This is 308's robot code for the 2024 FRC game Crescendo. In this game, robots must pick up orange foam rings called "notes" and score them in 3 different types of goals. In addition, they
also have to hang from a metal chain at the end of the match. As always, our code is open-source and free to view.
